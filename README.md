# AWordlist
  This is a simple script that can help you remember those foreign words. You can load the file "samplelist.txt" when running the application to have a try, and you can also refer the "samplelist.txt" to build your own wordlists :)
  ! The "samplelist.txt" can't work well in Windows because of the encode method. If you want to try it in Windows, you may have to copy the text from it, paste the text into a new Notpad and save it as a new text file.

update 1.1.0 : 2016.10.28
  - Now the script can adapt to both Windows and other platforms that support Python.
  - Add the function that can record the words you have seen and count how many times you've forgotten them. 
  - And you can type the command "tt r [num]" to review the words you've seen. The priority would base on the counting which the former line mentioned.
